This work was initiated at the end of 2017. There have been significant changes in recent years. For example, many defects are now outdated and will appear in recent Solidity versions. Additionally, smart contracts have become much more complicated compared to those in 2017. Thus, we have proposed a new dataset. Please refer to our latest work:
